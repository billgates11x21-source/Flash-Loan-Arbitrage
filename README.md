# Arbitrage smart contract to perform On-Chain Arbitrage Trading 

- The Arbitrage contract is a smart contract that can be used to perform arbitrage between Uniswap and Sushiswap. 

- Arbitrage is the process of buying an asset on one exchange and selling it on another exchange for a higher price. 

- This can be profitable when there are price differences between the two exchanges.

- The Arbitrage contract takes two parameters: the amount of USDT and WBTC to trade, and the two trading paths to use. 

- The first trading path is used to buy USDT on Uniswap. The second trading path is used to sell USDT on Sushiswap.

- The contract will then compare the prices of USDT on both exchanges and determine if there is an arbitrage opportunity. 

- If there is an arbitrage opportunity, the contract will automatically trade between the two exchanges to make a profit.

- The Arbitrage contract is a powerful tool that can be used to make money from arbitrage opportunities. 

- However, it is important to note that arbitrage trading is not without risk. 

- There is always the possibility that the price of an asset could change significantly between the time the contract buys and sells it.
