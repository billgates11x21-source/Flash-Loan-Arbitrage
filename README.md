# Ethereum Smart Contracts for Arbitrage and Flash Loans

This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts for performing arbitrage trading and utilizing flash loans on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

## Contracts Overview

### 1. Arbitrage.sol

#### Description:
The `Arbitrage.sol` contract facilitates automated arbitrage trading between Uniswap and Sushiswap DEX platforms.

#### Features:
- **Automated Trading:** Executes trades based on predefined parameters to exploit price differences between Uniswap and Sushiswap.
- **Slippage Tolerance:** Adjustable slippage tolerance ensures trades are executed profitably within specified parameters.
- **Owner Controls:** Allows the contract owner to adjust slippage tolerance and withdraw tokens.

### 2. FlashLoan.sol

#### Description:
The `FlashLoan.sol` contract demonstrates how to execute a simple flash loan using the Aave protocol.

#### Features:
- **Flash Loan Execution:** Requests and handles flash loans from the Aave protocol.
- **Trade Execution:** Example functionality swaps the flash loaned asset for WETH using Uniswap V2.
- **Owner Controls:** Allows the contract owner to execute flash loans and handle loan repayments.

### 3. Flash-Loan-Arbitrage.sol

#### Description:
The `Flash-Loan-Arbitrage.sol` contract integrates flash loans with arbitrage trading strategies, utilizing Uniswap V2 for enhanced trading opportunities.

#### Features:
- **Combined Strategies:** Executes arbitrage opportunities using flash loans from the Aave protocol and trading on Uniswap V2.
- **Customizable Logic:** Demonstrates advanced trading strategies while leveraging flash loan capabilities.
- **Owner Controls:** Allows the contract owner to execute complex trading and manage flash loan repayments.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have access to an Ethereum node or provider like Infura.
- Use a development environment like Remix or Truffle for local testing and deployment.

### Deployment
1. Deploy contracts on an EVM-compatible network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Arbitrum, Mumbai testnet).
2. Set appropriate permissions and parameters as defined in each contract's constructor.

### Interacting with Contracts
- Use Ethereum wallets or scripts to interact with deployed contracts.
- Follow specific contract methods like `performArbitrage` in `Arbitrage.sol`, `executeOperation` in `FlashLoan.sol`, or integrated methods in `Flash-Loan-Arbitrage.sol`.

## Risks
- **Market Risks:** Arbitrage and flash loan trading carry inherent market risks, including price volatility and slippage.
- **Contract Risks:** Smart contract interactions are irreversible; ensure parameters and transactions are validated thoroughly.
